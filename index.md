# Selling:
You will need to download the "Clover Go G1 - Point Of Sale" from android or apple app store onto your phone. (NOT the Clover G2 dashboard)

We will supply login/password for each location. Each location has it's own username/password - please make sure you use the right one (if you have sold in both locations you could accidentally use the wrong username/password - so please check.)

There will be a tally sheet for each type of box sold, we just want to keep track of what we sold on paper too. It will be in the box.

Clover is really easy to use. The card readers will be fully charged when you pick them up - they should last all day. If not call me Lee 404-405-1194 - they are charged via USB.
