We will supply login/password for each location. Each location has it's own username/password - please make sure you use the right one (if you have sold in both locations you could accidentally use the wrong username/password - so please check.)

There will be a tally sheet for each type of box sold, we just want to keep track of what we sold on paper too. It will be in the box.

Clover is really easy to use. The card readers will be fully charged when you pick them up - they should last all day. If not [Call Lee](tel:4044051194) - they are charged via USB.
