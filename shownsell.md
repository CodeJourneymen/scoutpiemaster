We are selling at [Dollar General](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dollar+General/@35.1744822,-85.3314633,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x8860f449559ad427:0xd12cea5ca04fd5cf!4m5!3m4!1s0x8860f44bffddafb7:0x14737cbbf3090bd2!8m2!3d35.1744822!4d-85.3292746) ,

[Ace Hardware](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ppy6E4F8XSrnRCrD9)


### There are 4 selling slots per location  - so we need 8 signups each day - 4 for each location. Plus 4 more signups for the extra Food City and Ace weekends.

It's possible for 2 cub families to be selling in one location at the same time - and share a slot, but please fill out all slots in a day before doubling up.<br/>
If not all slots are filled on a day we'd prefer the last slot to be empty, so the stall doesn't have to be broken down and re-put up in a single day.<br/>
Slots are 2 hours long. 
- 10am to Noon
- Noon to 2pm
- 2pm to 4pm
- 4pm to 6pm

### Each day and location has a seperate SignupGenius.
