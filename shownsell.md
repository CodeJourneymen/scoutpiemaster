### There are 4 selling slots per location  - so we need 8 signups each day - 4 for each location.

It's possible for 2 cub families to be selling in one location at the same time - and share a slot, but please fill out the day before doubling up.<br/>
If not all slots are filled on a day we'd prefer the last slot to be empty, so the stall doesn't have to be broken down and re-put up in a single day.<br/>
Slots are 2 hours long. 
- 10am to Noon
- Noon to 2pm
- 2pm to 4pm
- 4pm to 6pm

# Selling:
You will need to download the "Clover Go G1 - Point Of Sale" from android or apple app store onto your phone. (NOT the Clover G2 dashboard)
- [Clover for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firstdata.clovergo&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [Clover for Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clover-go-g1-point-of-sale/id999050522)

We will supply login/password for each location. Each location has it's own username/password - please make sure you use the right one (if you have sold in both locations you could accidentally use the wrong username/password - so please check.)

There will be a tally sheet for each type of box sold, we just want to keep track of what we sold on paper too. It will be in the box.

Clover is really easy to use. The card readers will be fully charged when you pick them up - they should last all day. If not [Call Lee](tel:4044051194) - they are charged via USB.
