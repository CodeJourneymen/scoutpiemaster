### There are 4 selling slots per location  - so we need 8 signups each day - 4 for each location. Plus 4 more signups for the extra Food City and Ace weekends.

It's possible for 2 cub families to be selling in one location at the same time - and share a slot, but please fill out all slots in a day before doubling up.<br/>
If not all slots are filled on a day we'd prefer the last slot to be empty, so the stall doesn't have to be broken down and re-put up in a single day.<br/>
Slots are 2 hours long. 
- 10am to Noon
- Noon to 2pm
- 2pm to 4pm
- 4pm to 6pm

### Each day and location has a seperate SignupGenius.
