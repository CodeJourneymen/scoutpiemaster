We are selling at [Dollar General](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dollar+General/@35.1744822,-85.3314633,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x8860f449559ad427:0xd12cea5ca04fd5cf!4m5!3m4!1s0x8860f44bffddafb7:0x14737cbbf3090bd2!8m2!3d35.1744822!4d-85.3292746) and [Pruetts Market](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pruett's+Market/@35.1386309,-85.330655,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8860f5919d29f255:0x510723ddf790f66a!8m2!3d35.1386309!4d-85.328461)

We have [Ace Hardware](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Elder's+Ace+Hardware-+Walden/@35.1546421,-85.319739,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8860f5a6f5c443f7:0x1c7c9b0e2a8c4c0!8m2!3d35.1546421!4d-85.3171587!16s%2Fg%2F1tdwl729?entry=ttu) as a location too - once per month. <br/>
This will be a 3rd location for those weekends.

### There are 4 selling slots per location  - so we need 8 signups each day - 4 for each location. Plus 4 more signups for the two extra Ace weekends.

It's possible for 2 cub families to be selling in one location at the same time - and share a slot, but please fill out the day before doubling up.<br/>
If not all slots are filled on a day we'd prefer the last slot to be empty, so the stall doesn't have to be broken down and re-put up in a single day.<br/>
Slots are 2 hours long. 
- 10am to Noon
- Noon to 2pm
- 2pm to 4pm
- 4pm to 6pm

### Each day and location has a seperate SignupGenius.

All Signup Genius links for September/October 2023.

# Selling:
You will need to download the "Clover Go - Dashboard & POS" from Android or Apple app store onto your phone.
- [Clover for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=clover.companion.app&hl=en_US&gl=US)
- [Clover for Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clover-go-dashboard-pos/id969311778)

We will supply login/password for each location. **Each location has it's own username/password** - please make sure you use the right one (if you have sold in both locations you could accidentally use the wrong username/password - so please check.)

Clover is really easy to use. The card readers will be fully charged when you pick them up - they should last all day. If not [Call Lee](tel:4044051194) or [Sean 202-246-4633](tel:2022464633) - they are charged via USB.
